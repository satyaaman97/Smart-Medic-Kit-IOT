# Smart-Medic-Kit-IOT
Developed a smart medic kit for storing medicines. The idea was to make the process of having medicines simpler for older folks. You can store the medicines in the boxes according to the time of the day. The kit comes with an app where one can set a reminder for when to take the medicines. The boxes are fitted with the IR sensors which would sense the medicines inside the box and will send the information to the cloud. The app would retrieve the data from cloud and it will be displayed. The app also sends secondary reminder if you missed taking medicines .
